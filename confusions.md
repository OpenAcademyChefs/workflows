#Confusions

This is a document for recording the confusions introduced by/questions not answered by the chef docs.

##Knife

The docs at learn.chef.io tell us to download the client keys & knife config into chef-repo. But other parts of the docs suggest that they ought to be at ~/.chef

For now, I symlinked ~/.chef -> chef-repo/.chef but this feels like a hack.
