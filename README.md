# workflows

While working on cookbooks recently, I have found it tough to find the "right" way to do a lot of things. The docs at [docs.chef.io] are a bit convoluted and often provide too many different alternative methods of doing things to be helpful. I wanted to start gathering a lot of the workflow-related knowledge into a central location, so that a few things can happen:

- Other group members with similar questions can find the answers here (especially relevant now that we have more chefs)
- The workflows can be collaboratively edited/optimized. We are more likely to catch each other's/our own mistakes this way
- Potential for contributing to chef documentation if we end up with enough useful and well-organized info towards the end of the semester
